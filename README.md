# Console-Hero

A [Dungeon World](http://www.dungeon-world.com/) command line helper. As of yet only supports querying moves. But has autocompletion and history, thanks to [rustyline](https://github.com/kkawakam/rustyline).
The data used in this project comes from the [DungeonWorldData](https://github.com/Vindexus/DungeonWorldData) project.


## Example

```
>> move A Little Help From My Friends

 ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
 ┃ A Little Help From My Friends          ┃
 ┣━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┫
 ┃ Class: bard                            ┃
 ┠────────────────────────────────────────┨
 ┃ When you successfully aid someone you  ┃
 ┃ take +1 forward as well.               ┃
 ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
```

Thanks to the creators of Dungeon World!
